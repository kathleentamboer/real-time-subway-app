#real-time-subway-app
====================

Native vs. Web

Team #Fo_Sho decided a native qpp would be the best platform to work with in creating the real-time-subway-app. The decision was made due to many critical client and user needs that focused on offline accessability, text-based messages from client to user, and access to a built in GPS system.
